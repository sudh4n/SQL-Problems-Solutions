Question:
Write an SQL query to find the total revenue (total price = quantity Ã— price) generated from "Delivered" orders for each month in the year 2024.

Expected Output Format:
month	            total_revenue
2024-01	          51500
2024-02	          48000'''

SELECT 
LEFT(order_date, 7) AS month,  -- Extract YYYY-MM and takes only 7 characters
SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue  
FROM 
Orders
WHERE 
status = 'Delivered'  -- only "Delivered" orders
GROUP BY 
month;
